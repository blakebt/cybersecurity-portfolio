# Brenden Blake Cybersecurity Portfolio

## [Incident Report](./IncidentReport/IncidentReport.md)
Inside the IncidentReport directory you will find an incident report completed by myself for the Google Cybersecurity Certificate program. A security incident was described in the prompt and I was asked to review the incident
and analyze it using the NIST CSF framework.

## Permissions
Inside the Permissions directory you will find a project in which I was asked to complete a series of tasks related to changes the permissions of a number of files, hidden files, and directories using the Linux shell.
The report includes a report that shows my knowledge of the permissions string and the commands used to manipulate it. I use commands such as 'ls' and its '-l' and '-la' modifiers. I also use 'chmod' to add and remove permissions
for the three owner types.

## Security Audit
Inside of the SecurityAudit directory you will find a security audit completed by myself for the Google Cybersecurity Certificate program. The scope and goals along with the risk assessment was provided by the course.
The controls assessment, compliance checklist, and recommendations were all completed by myself.

## SQL Queries
Inside of the SQLQueries directory you will find a project in which I was tasked with executed a number of SQL queries to help with an investigation into login attempts and to help with identifying computers that required updates.
The report includes the specific queries that I used for each task and images of the results.
