## Incident Report
Inside the IncidentReport directory you will find an incident report completed by myself for the Google Cybersecurity Certificate program. A security incident was described in the prompt and I was asked to review the incident
and analyze it using the NIST CSF framework.

## Security Audit
Inside of the SecurityAudit directory you will find a security audit completed by myself for the Google Cybersecurity Certificate program. The scope and goals along with the risk assessment was provided by the course.
The controls assessment, compliance checklist, and recommendations were all completed by myself.
